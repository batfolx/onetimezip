efficient, O(1) runtime, one-way only file compression  
you need an input file to compress and the name of the output compressed file

getting started:  
contents of inputfile.txt  

    hello, this is an uncompressed file with some text  
    
we then run the code  


    python3 zip.py inputfile.txt outputfile.txt

the program will output  

    compressing file ...
    compressing finished

which yields the contents of the compressed `outputfile.txt` file

you can turn any amount data into a single byte of data in no time
